# Identifying-Machine-Generated-Text
AI assistants for article generation

This project provides a pipeline to **detect whether text was written by a human or generated by AI**, and to **analyze the degree of bias** in the text.  
It combines three models from Hugging Face: GPT-2 Detector, Zero-Shot Classifier, and Sentiment Analyzer.

## 🔹 1. GPT-2 Detector Model
- **Model Used:** `roberta-base-openai-detector` (from Hugging Face)  
- **Purpose:** Detect whether text was generated by AI (like GPT) or written by a human.  
- **Method:**  
  - A **RoBERTa-based classifier** fine-tuned by OpenAI on human-written vs. GPT-2-generated text.  
  - Outputs a probability score:  
    - **High score → likely AI-generated**  
    - **Low score → likely human-written**

## 🔹 2. Zero-Shot Classification Model
- **Model Used:** `facebook/bart-large-mnli`  
- **Purpose:** Perform **bias detection** by checking if the text contains subjective or opinionated language.  
- **Method:**  
  - **Zero-shot classification** allows testing against custom labels (`"unbiased"`, `"biased"`, `"neutral"`) without retraining.  
  - Uses **natural language inference (NLI)** to decide which label best matches the text.  
  - Example: If text shows favoritism, it scores higher for `"biased"`.

## 🔹 3. Sentiment Analysis Model
- **Model Used:** `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`  
- **Purpose:** Check for **emotional tone**, which indirectly signals **bias or subjectivity**.  
- **Method:**  
  - Trained on movie reviews (positive vs. negative).  
  - Extremely **positive or negative tone → may reflect bias**.  
  - **Neutral tone → likely objective**.

## ⚡️ How They Work Together
1. **Step 1:** GPT-2 detector → Determines if text is AI-generated or human-written.  
2. **Step 2:** Zero-shot classifier → Evaluates bias level (`biased`, `unbiased`, `neutral`).  
3. **Step 3:** Sentiment analyzer → Cross-checks for emotional bias.  

### ✅ Final Output:  
- Whether the text was **AI-generated or human-written**.  
- **Bias level** (with score).  
- **Sentiment tendency** (positive / negative / neutral).
