🔹 1. GPT-2 Detector Model

Model Used: roberta-base-openai-detector (from Hugging Face).

Purpose: Detect whether text was generated by AI (like GPT) or written by a human.

Method:

The detector is a RoBERTa-based classifier fine-tuned by OpenAI on human-written text vs. GPT-2-generated text.

It outputs a probability score:

High score → likely AI-generated.

Low score → likely human-written.

🔹 2. Zero-Shot Classification Model

Model Used: facebook/bart-large-mnli.

Purpose: Perform bias detection by checking if the text contains subjective or opinionated language.

Method:

Zero-shot classification means the model can test text against custom labels (like "unbiased", "biased", "neutral") without retraining.

It uses natural language inference (NLI) to decide which label best matches the text.

Example: If text shows favoritism, it scores higher for "biased".

🔹 3. Sentiment Analysis Model

Model Used: distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english.

Purpose: Check for emotional tone, which indirectly signals bias or subjectivity.

Method:

Trained on movie reviews (positive vs. negative).

If text is extremely positive or negative, it may reflect bias.

Neutral text → likely objective.

⚡️ How They Work Together

Step 1: GPT-2 detector → Tells if text is AI or human.

Step 2: Zero-shot classifier → Evaluates bias level (biased, unbiased, neutral).

Step 3: Sentiment model → Cross-checks if emotional bias exists.

Final Output: Combines results into a report:

Was it AI-generated or human-written?

Bias level (with score).

Sentiment tendency (positive/negative/neutral).
